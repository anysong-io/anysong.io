  "readme": "# lite-server\n\nLightweight *development only* node server that serves a web app, opens it in the browser, refreshes when html or javascript change, injects CSS changes using sockets, and has a fallback page when a route is not found.\n\n[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/johnpapa/lite-server.svg)](https://david-dm.org/johnpapa/lite-server)\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/lite-server.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/lite-server)\n\n## Why\n\nBrowserSync does most of what we want in a super fast lightweight development server. It serves the static content, detects changes, refreshes the browser, and offers many customizations.\n\nWhen creating a SPA there are routes that are only known to the browser. For example, `/customer/21` may be a client side route for an Angular app. If this route is entered manually or linked to directly as the entry point of the Angular app (aka a deep link) the static server will receive the request, because Angular is not loaded yet. The server will not find a match for the route and thus return a 404. The desired behavior in this case is to return the `index.html` (or whatever starting page of the app we have defined). BrowserSync does not automatically allow for a fallback page. But it does allow for custom middleware. This is where `lite-server` steps in.\n\n`lite-server` is a simple customized wrapper around BrowserSync to make it easy to serve SPAs.\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\nThe recommended installation method is a local NPM install for your project:\n```bash\n$ npm install lite-server --save-dev\n```\n\n...and add a \"script\" entry within your project's `package.json` file:\n```\n# Inside package.json...\n  \"scripts\": {    \n    \"dev\": \"lite-server\"\n  },\n```\n\nWith the above script entry, you can then start `lite-server` via:\n```bash\n$ npm run dev\n```\n\nOther options for running locally installed NPM binaries is discussed in this Stack Overflow question: [How to use package installed locally in node_modules](http://stackoverflow.com/q/9679932)\n\n### Global Installation\n\nlite-server can be also installed globally, if preferred:\n```bash\n$ npm install -g lite-server\n\n# To run:\n$ lite-server\n```\n\n## Custom Configuration\n\nThe default behavior serves from the current folder, opens a browser, and applies a HTML5 route fallback to `./index.html`.\n\nlite-server uses [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/), and allows for configuration overrides via a local `bs-config.json` or `bs-config.js` file in your project.\n\nYou can provide custom path to your config file via `-c` or `--config=` run time options:\n```bash\nlite-server -c configs/my-bs-config.js\n```\n\nFor example, to change the server port, watched file paths, and base directory for your project, create a `bs-config.json` in your project's folder:\n```json\n{\n  \"port\": 8000,\n  \"files\": [\"./src/**/*.{html,htm,css,js}\"],\n  \"server\": { \"baseDir\": \"./src\" }\n}\n```\n\nA more complicated example with modifications to the server middleware can be done with a `bs-config.js` file, which requires the `module.exports = { ... };` syntax:\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  server: {\n    middleware: {\n      // overrides the second middleware default with new settings\n      1: require('connect-history-api-fallback')({index: '/index.html', verbose: true})\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**NOTE:** Keep in mind that when using middleware overrides the specific middleware module must be installed in your project. For the above example, you'll need to do:\n```bash\n$ npm install connect-history-api-fallback --save-dev\n```\n\n...otherwise you'll get an error similar to:\n```\nError: Cannot find module 'connect-history-api-fallback'\n```\n\nAnother example: To remove one of the [default middlewares](./lib/config-defaults.js), such as `connect-logger`, you can set it's array index to `null`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  server: {\n    middleware: {      \n      0: null     // removes default `connect-logger` middleware\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nA list of the entire set of BrowserSync options can be found in its docs: <http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/>\n\n## Known Issues\nCSS with Angular 2 is embedded thus even though BrowserSync detects the file change to CSS, it does not inject the file via sockets. As a workaround, `injectChanges` defaults to `false`.\n\n## License\n\nCode released under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).\n",
